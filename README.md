  <hr>If you or your prefered browser doesn't have or like uBlock Origin, then this is a blocklist for ALL ad blockers, agnostic of which one or what OS. <sub>I made this because I prefer macOS with Safari and uBlock origin is no longer supported on Safari</sub></body>
<h2>Requirements</h2>
<ul>
  <li>ad blocker installed and enabled**</li>
  <li>Copy and Paste blocklist.txt into your user/custom filters.</li>
</ul>
